**AttachME**
AttachME is a modern Android application designed to connect students seeking internships with companies offering opportunities. It leverages the power of Jetpack Compose for the UI, Firebase Authentication for user management, and Firestore for real-time data syncing, creating a seamless experience for both students and companies.

**Features**
User Authentication: Students and companies can sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication. Students can view internship opportunities, while companies can post and manage their internship listings.

**Post Internships:** Companies can easily create and post internship opportunities, including details like company name, position title, description, requirements, location, duration, available slots, and application deadline.

**Browse Opportunities:** Students can browse available internships in real-time, ordered by the most recently posted. They can also apply directly for positions of interest.

**Real-Time Updates:** Internship listings are automatically updated in real-time using Firestore. As companies post or modify opportunities, the changes are reflected immediately for all users.

**Clean UI:** Built with Jetpack Compose, the app provides a modern and fluid user interface optimized for both phone and tablet devices. The design is simple yet effective, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Error Handling:** Proper error states are displayed to users in case of failures or loading issues, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

**Tech Stack**
Android: The app is built using the latest Android technologies, including Jetpack Compose for the user interface and ViewModel for managing UI-related data lifecycle-consciously.

****Firebase:**
Firebase Authentication for user sign-up, login, and account management.

Cloud Firestore for storing and managing internship opportunities in real-time.

Kotlin: The app is written in Kotlin, leveraging its modern, expressive syntax to handle both backend logic and UI components.

Dagger Hilt: Dependency injection is handled with Dagger Hilt for better scalability, cleaner code, and easy testing.

Coroutines & Flow: Kotlin Coroutines and Flow are used to manage background tasks and stream data, ensuring smooth and responsive performance even with large amounts of data.

**Setup
Prerequisites**
Before you can run the app, you'll need to set up Firebase and link it to your Android project.

Create a Firebase Project:

Go to Firebase Console.

Create a new project or use an existing one.

Set up Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore for the project.

**Connect Firebase to Your Android App:**

Add your app to the Firebase project in the Firebase Console.

Download the google-services.json file and add it to the app folder of your Android project.

**Enable Firebase Authentication:**

Go to the Authentication section of Firebase Console.

Enable email/password authentication or other authentication methods that you want to support (Google, Facebook, etc.).

**Add Firebase SDK:**

Open your build.gradle files and add the Firebase dependencies, as detailed in the Firebase documentation.

Sync the project with Gradle files.

**Running the App**
Clone this repository to your local machine:

 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AttachME.git
Open the project in Android Studio.

Ensure your google-services.json file is correctly placed in the app/ directory.

Build and run the app on your emulator or physical device:

Select your device or emulator.

Click Run in Android Studio.

**Testing**
Unit tests for the repository layer and view models have been written using JUnit and are located under the src/test directory. Android instrumentation tests can be found in src/androidTest.

To run tests, simply use Android Studio's Run Tests feature, or from the command line:

 
./gradlew test
For UI tests, you can use:

 
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
**Directory Structure**
app/: Contains the main Android app module.

data/: Includes repository classes and data models, responsible for interacting with Firebase.

ui/: Contains Jetpack Compose UI components and screens.

viewmodel/: ViewModels to manage UI-related data and interactions.

**Future Improvements**
Push Notifications: Enable push notifications to alert students when new internships are posted or when their applications are reviewed.

User Profiles: Allow students to update their profiles with additional information such as resumes, portfolio links, and preferences.

Search Functionality: Implement a search feature to help students easily filter internship listings based on various criteria like location, field, or duration.

Company Dashboards: Provide companies with a dashboard to manage their internship postings, review applications, and track student progress.
